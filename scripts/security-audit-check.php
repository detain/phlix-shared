/**
 * S246 — give this repository a security audit gate that covers the WHOLE lock,
 * states the corpus it examined, and is capable of failing.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes, measured 2026-08-06
 *
 * The "Security Audit" job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was two steps:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * - run: composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist --no-dev
 * - run: composer audit --no-dev
 * ```
 *
 * `--no-dev` removes every `require-dev` package from the audited set, so **no
 * advisory against a development dependency could ever fail this gate**. This
 * repo's lock pinned `squizlabs/php_codesniffer` — a `require-dev` package — and
 * the job reported SUCCESS against a vulnerable lock.
 *
 * On 2026-08-06 a HIGH advisory landed against `squizlabs/php_codesniffer` —
 * CVE-2026-67434, OS command injection, GHSA-hmqg-cxww-wqhq, affecting
 * `<3.13.6` and `>=4.0.0,<4.0.2`. Across the estate only phlix-server went red,
 * because only phlix-server audited its development dependencies. Everywhere
 * else the advisory was simply invisible, and "invisible" is indistinguishable
 * from "clean".
 *
 * A gate that silently covers half its subject is worse than no gate, because it
 * is read as evidence.
 *
 * ## The policy: audit EVERYTHING, and block on everything
 *
 * The two honest shapes were (a) audit everything and fix promptly, or (b) audit
 * runtime dependencies as blocking and development dependencies as a separate,
 * clearly-labelled non-blocking report. **This gate implements (a)**, the same
 * policy phlix-hub adopted under S246 (PR #217):
 *
 *  1. **A dev dependency is not a safe dependency.** The advisory that exposed
 *     this hole is command injection in a linter that CI runs, in a checkout,
 *     against pull-request-authored content. The developer workstation and the
 *     CI runner are exactly the machines that hold the signing keys and the
 *     deploy credentials. "It does not ship" is not the same as "it cannot hurt
 *     you".
 *  2. **Every advisory here is labelled with its scope.** The report prints
 *     `[require]` or `[require-dev]` against each affected package, so a reader
 *     can tell in one glance whether production is exposed or only the toolchain
 *     is. Option (b) buys that same information at the price of a second,
 *     non-blocking channel that nobody reads.
 *  3. **There is a recorded escape hatch.** An advisory that genuinely cannot be
 *     actioned is acknowledged in `composer.json` under `config.audit.ignore`
 *     with a written reason, which this script then reports as a loud IGNORED
 *     notice. That is an explicit, reviewable, in-repo decision — the opposite
 *     of a flag that quietly excludes most of the lock.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no baseline file and no ignore list in this script**.
 * The only way to pass an advisory is to fix it or to acknowledge it in
 * `composer.json`, where it is committed, diffed and reviewed.
 *
 * ## Blocking vs advisory
 *
 * `composer audit` returns one exit code for several very different findings, so
 * the verdict here is computed from `--format=json` rather than inherited from
 * `$?`:
 *
 * | finding                       | verdict                                   |
 * | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
 * | security advisory (any scope) | **BLOCKING** — exit 1                     |
 * | abandoned package             | ADVISORY — loud `::warning::`, exit 0     |
 * | advisory ignored via config   | ADVISORY — loud `::notice::`, exit 0      |
 * | unreachable advisory repo     | **BLOCKING** — exit 1 (audited nothing)   |
 * | missing / unparseable JSON    | **BLOCKING** — exit 1                     |
 * | corpus below its floor        | **BLOCKING** — exit 1 (audited too little)|
 * | composer absent or < 2.4      | **BLOCKING** — exit 1                     |
 *
 * Abandonment is not a vulnerability and is usually unfixable from this repo, so
 * it warns rather than blocks: a gate that goes red for a reason nobody here can
 * act on gets switched off, and that is precisely how blind gates come to exist.
 * The unreachable-repository row is the same rule as the corpus floor — a gate
 * that could not measure must fail, never report success.
 *
 * ## The corpus, and why it is printed
 *
 * `composer audit` never says how many packages it looked at, and "inspected
 * zero files" is the commonest false pass in this estate: it looks exactly like
 * a clean run. So this script counts the audited set out of `composer.lock`
 * itself and prints it — total, `require`, and `require-dev` — then refuses to
 * pass if either the total or the dev half falls below its floor. The dev floor
 * is the specific anti-regression for S246: if `--no-dev` ever appears, or
 * `packages-dev` is emptied, the corpus line says so out loud and the gate fails
 * instead of reporting a clean audit of a fraction of the lock.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   php scripts/security-audit-check.php                       # runs composer audit itself
 *   php scripts/security-audit-check.php audit.json            # reads a captured payload
 *   php scripts/security-audit-check.php audit.json other.lock # ...against another lock
 *
 * The optional arguments exist so the guard tests can exercise every verdict
 * offline, without a network round-trip to Packagist.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   COMPOSER_BIN  path to the composer binary (default: `composer` on PATH)
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = no blocking finding. 1 = a security advisory was found, OR the
 * audit could not run over a credible corpus (which is a failure, not a skip).
