/**
 * Contract every Phlix plugin entry class implements.
 *
 * The entry class is whatever FQCN appears in `plugin.json#/entry`. The
 * loader instantiates it through the host PSR-11 container — so the
 * entry class may type-hint any binding the container can resolve in
 * its constructor and PHP-DI will autowire them.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * - **enable phase** — {@see self::onEnable()} runs after the manifest
 *   is loaded, the plugin's `vendor/autoload.php` is registered, and
 *   the entry class is instantiated. The host container is passed in
 *   so the plugin can resolve services lazily.
 * - **enable phase** — {@see self::subscribedEvents()} runs immediately
 *   after {@see onEnable()} returns, to obtain the list of
 *   `eventClassFqcn => callable` pairs the loader should attach to
 *   the PSR-14 dispatcher.
 * - **disable phase** — {@see self::onDisable()} runs before the
 *   loader unsubscribes the listeners returned earlier from
 *   {@see subscribedEvents()}.
 *
 * Plugins should keep {@see onEnable()} cheap: any heavy initialisation
 * (HTTP client warmup, background workers) belongs in the listeners
 * themselves, which only run when a relevant event fires.
 *
 * ## Subscribed events
 *
 * {@see self::subscribedEvents()} returns a map keyed by **event FQCN**
 * (e.g. `\Phlix\Shared\Events\Playback\PlaybackStarted::class`) to
 * either:
 *
 * - A PHP `callable` (closure, `[$plugin, 'methodName']`, invokable
 *   object, …) that accepts the event instance and returns void.
 * - A method name (string), which the loader binds as
 *   `[$pluginInstance, $methodName]` for convenience.
 *
 * The loader translates manifest aliases (`phlix.playback.started`) to
 * FQCNs via {@see \Phlix\Shared\Plugin\EventNameMap} before calling this
 * method, so plugin authors deal exclusively with FQCNs at runtime.
 *
